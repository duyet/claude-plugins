Invoke the `claude-md-optimizer` skill to perform a comprehensive analysis and optimization of CLAUDE.md files in this project.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes your codebase** - Detects project type, tech stack, directory structure
2. **Assesses existing CLAUDE.md** - Checks line count, sections, anti-patterns
3. **Applies best practices** - From Anthropic, HumanLayer, and community experts
4. **Generates optimization report** - Effectiveness score, issues, recommendations
5. **Provides actionable fixes** - Prioritized by impact with quick wins

## Key Best Practices Applied

- **Conciseness**: Target 100-200 lines (Claude Code already has ~50 instructions)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Point to files instead of embedding content
- **Declarative Style**: Bullet points over narrative paragraphs
- **Universal Applicability**: Only instructions that apply to every task

## Output Includes

- Effectiveness Score (1-10) with breakdown
- Anti-patterns detected with line references
- Priority recommendations (high/medium/low)
- Quick wins for immediate improvement
- Optional: Complete rewritten CLAUDE.md
