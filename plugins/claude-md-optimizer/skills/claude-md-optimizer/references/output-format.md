Recommended action: Create a new CLAUDE.md following the suggested structure below.

### Project Analysis

Based on codebase analysis:
- [Detected technologies]
- [Directory structure observations]
- [Testing framework if detected]
- [Build system if detected]
```

### For Excellent CLAUDE.md Files (Score 8+)

Add a "Maintenance Tips" section:

```markdown
## Maintenance Tips

Your CLAUDE.md is well-optimized. To maintain quality:

1. **Review monthly**: Check for outdated references
2. **Update with changes**: When adding features, update pointers
3. **Use # key**: Add instructions naturally during coding
4. **Team review**: Include in code review process
```

### For Critical Issues (Score <4)

Add urgency indicators:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **[Issue]**: [Description]
   - **Risk**: [What could go wrong]
   - **Immediate Action**: [What to do now]
```

## Tone Guidelines

- **Be direct**: State issues clearly without hedging
- **Be specific**: Use line numbers and exact quotes
- **Be actionable**: Every issue should have a fix
- **Be encouraging**: Note strengths before weaknesses
- **Be practical**: Prioritize by impact, not completeness
